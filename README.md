Dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles.

### How to get them into a new system

Copy `bin/dotgit-replicate` somewhere locally and run it. It will set up the repo and submodules. You can delete it afterwards.
First thing you should do is install [homebrew](brew.sh) and run `brew bundle install` in your home. You will see some errors until you do.

And that's it!
